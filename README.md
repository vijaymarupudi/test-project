by Alissa


Pre-requisite downloads for testing
1. Download Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
    This tool allows you to get the latest version of the code from my github
2. Download Simple Web Server -  https://simplewebserver.org/docs/wsc.html
    This allows you to see the numberline in your web browser

Quick set-up the guide
1. Check out the git repository.
    You can use the terminal/command line or use the Git GUI(I don't usually use this, you may need to look it up)
    For the terminal : Open the terminal window and navigate to the folder you want to download the code to. You can type the following to check out the code
         git clone https://github.com/AlissaLeeMcGill/number-line.git
    then to enter the folder, type
        cd number-line 
   to get the updated code, type
        git pull
        git submodule init
        git sumbodule update
2. Open the Simple Web Server App to create a local server for testing
3. Set the folder path to the top folder of the git repo ( YourFolderLocation/number-line )
4. In Basic options,  check "automatically show index.html"
5. Keep the rest of the settings default.
6. Visit the Websever URL by clicking on the link in the Simple Web Server App to see the number line



TODO:
1. Save time from start of trial to final response
2. Control point stays snapped to the numberline
3. Support fractions
4. Fixation/ Start point appears first
